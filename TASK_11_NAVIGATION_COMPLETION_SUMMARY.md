### ✅ 2. Update navigation active state management across all pages  
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: 
  - Each page correctly highlights its corresponding navigation item with the `active` class
  - Active state mapping verified for all pages:
    - index.html → nav-dashboard (active)
    - tickets.html → nav-tickets (active)
    - users.html → nav-users (active)
    - integration.html → nav-integration (active)
    - settings.html → nav-settings (active)
    - logs.html → nav-logs (active)

### ✅ 3. Ensure all navigation links point to correct pages
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: All navigation links verified to have correct href attributes:
  - Dashboard: `/admin/index.html`
  - Support Tickets: `/admin/tickets.html`
  - User Management: `/admin/users.html`
  - AI Integration: `/admin/integration.html`
  - Settings: `/admin/settings.html`
  - System Logs: `/admin/logs.html`

### ✅ 4. Test and fix any broken navigation links
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: 
  - Comprehensive testing performed using automated test scripts
  - All navigation links verified to exist and function correctly
  - No broken links found

### ✅ 5. Implement proper page title updates for each section
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: 
  - All pages have consistent page title structure: `[Page Name] - Admin Dashboard`
  - Page titles verified:
    - index.html: "Admin Dashboard - Customer Support System"
    - tickets.html: "Support Tickets - Admin Dashboard"
    - users.html: "User Management - Admin Dashboard"
    - integration.html: "AI Integration - Admin Dashboard" (updated for consistency)
    - settings.html: "Settings - Admin Dashboard"
    - logs.html: "System Logs - Admin Dashboard"
  - All pages have `id="page-title"` attribute for dynamic title updates

## Issues Fixed

### 🔧 Navigation Text Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: tickets.html and users.html had "Logs" instead of "System Logs"
- **Fix**: Updated navigation text to consistently use "System Logs" across all pages

### 🔧 Page Title Inconsistency
- **Issue**: integration.html had title "Integration Management" instead of "AI Integration"
- **Fix**: Updated page title to match navigation text: "AI Integration - Admin Dashboard"

### 🔧 Missing Page Title IDs
- **Issue**: integration.html and settings.html missing `id="page-title"` on h1 elements
- **Fix**: Added `id="page-title"` attributes for consistent JavaScript integration

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Structure
```html
<ul class="sidebar-nav">
    <li><a href="/admin/index.html" id="nav-dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/tickets.html" id="nav-tickets">Support Tickets</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/users.html" id="nav-users">User Management</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/integration.html" id="nav-integration">AI Integration</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/settings.html" id="nav-settings">Settings</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/logs.html" id="nav-logs">System Logs</a></li>
</ul>
```

### JavaScript Integration
- All pages include `navigation.js` for dynamic navigation management
- NavigationManager class handles:
  - Active state management
  - Breadcrumb generation
  - Search functionality
  - User dropdown management
  - Mobile navigation toggle

### Breadcrumb System
- All pages have breadcrumb containers: `<nav class="breadcrumb">`
- Breadcrumbs populated dynamically by navigation.js
- Consistent breadcrumb structure across all pages
