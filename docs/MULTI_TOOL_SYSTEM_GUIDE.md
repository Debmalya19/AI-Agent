3. **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Use comprehensive generator for complex queries
4. **BT-Specific Information**: Get current info from BT.com
5. **Additional Context**: Supplement with web search and Wikipedia
6. **Information Preservation**: Save important findings

### Example Workflow

```
Customer Query: "How do I upgrade my mobile plan and what are the current options?"

1. ContextRetriever ‚Üí Check internal knowledge base
2. SupportKnowledgeBase ‚Üí Look for upgrade-related support responses
3. BTPlansInformation ‚Üí Get current plans from BT.com
4. BTWebsiteSearch ‚Üí Search for upgrade process on BT.com
5. Web Search ‚Üí Find additional context about plan upgrades
6. Multi-Tool Orchestrator ‚Üí Combine all information into comprehensive answer
```
