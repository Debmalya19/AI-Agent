# Main.py Class Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Import Statements
**Problem**: The file had duplicate `import asyncio` statements on lines 18 and 35, which could cause confusion and potential issues.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate import statement, keeping only one `import asyncio` at the top of the file with other imports.

### 2. Misplaced Import Statement
**Problem**: There was an import statement in the middle of the file:
```python
# Set shared memory manager for tools
from backend.tools import set_shared_memory_manager
```

**Fix**: Moved this import to the top of the file with all other imports for better organization and Python best practices.

## Classes Verified

All Pydantic model classes are properly structured and working:

### 1. RegisterRequest Class
```python
class RegisterRequest(PydanticBaseModel):
    user_id: str
    username: str
    email: str
    full_name: Optional[str] = None
    password: str
```

### 2. ChatRequest Class
```python
class ChatRequest(PydanticBaseModel):
    query: str
```

### 3. ChatResponse Class
```python
class ChatResponse(PydanticBaseModel):
    topic: str
    summary: str
    sources: list[str] = []
    tools_used: list[str] = []
    confidence_score: float = 0.0
    execution_time: float = 0.0
    ui_state: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    content_type: str = "plain_text"
```

## Verification Results

✅ **Syntax Check**: `python -m py_compile main.py` - No errors
✅ **Import Test**: All classes can be imported successfully
✅ **Runtime Test**: Application initializes without errors

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Import Organization**: All imports are now properly organized at the top of the file
2. **No Duplicate Imports**: Removed redundant import statements
3. **Clean Structure**: Better separation between imports and application logic

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Code**: Better organized imports following Python conventions
- **No Conflicts**: Eliminated potential import conflicts from duplicates
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and understand the codebase
- **Performance**: Slightly better import performance without duplicates

The main.py file now has properly structured classes and clean import organization, making it more maintainable and following Python best practices.
