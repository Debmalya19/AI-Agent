# Memory Layer Manager Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Memory Manager Initialization
**Problem**: The Memory Layer Manager was being initialized multiple times during startup, causing duplicate log messages:
- Once in `main.py`
- Once in `backend/tools.py`
- Once in `backend/enhanced_rag_orchestrator.py`
- Once in `backend/intelligent_chat/chat_manager.py`

**Solution**: Implemented a singleton pattern where:
- Memory manager is initialized once in `main.py`
- Shared instance is passed to all components that need it
- Added `set_shared_memory_manager()` function in `tools.py`
- Updated all components to use provided instances instead of creating new ones

### 2. User Logout Memory Cleanup
**Problem**: Memory data was not being cleaned up when users logged out, leading to potential memory leaks and stale data.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logout cleanup functionality:
- New `cleanup_user_session_data()` method in `MemoryLayerManager`
- Cleans up old conversations (older than 1 hour)
- Removes user's context cache entries
- Cleans up old tool usage metrics (older than 24 hours)
- Integrated cleanup into the logout endpoint in `main.py`

## Changes Made

### 1. `backend/memory_layer_manager.py`
- Enhanced initialization logging to show configuration details
- Added `cleanup_user_session_data()` method for user-specific cleanup
- Improved error handling and logging throughout

### 2. `main.py`
- Implemented singleton memory manager initialization
- Added shared memory manager setup for tools
- Enhanced logout endpoint with memory cleanup
- Removed duplicate logout endpoint
- Improved startup logging

### 3. `backend/tools.py`
- Replaced direct memory manager initialization with shared instance pattern
- Added `set_shared_memory_manager()` function
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback handling

### 4. `backend/enhanced_rag_orchestrator.py`
- Updated to use provided memory manager instance instead of creating new one
- Prevents duplicate initialization

### 5. `backend/intelligent_chat/chat_manager.py`
- Updated to use provided instances instead of auto-creating new ones
- Eliminates duplicate memory manager creation

## Startup Log Improvements

### Before:
```
INFO:backend.memory_layer_manager:Memory Layer Manager initialized
INFO:backend.context_retrieval_engine:Context Retrieval Engine initialized
INFO:backend.memory_layer_manager:Memory Layer Manager initialized
INFO:backend.context_retrieval_engine:Context Retrieval Engine initialized
```

### After:
```
INFO:main:Configuration validation passed
INFO:main:Gemini LLM initialized successfully
INFO:main:Agent and executor created successfully
INFO:backend.memory_layer_manager:Memory Layer Manager initialized with config: storage=True, context_retrieval=True, tool_analytics=True
INFO:root:Memory layer performance optimized for intelligent_chat.tool_orchestrator
INFO:backend.intelligent_chat.context_retriever:ContextRetriever initialized with UI enhancements
INFO:main:Intelligent chat UI components initialized successfully
```

## User Logout Cleanup Features

### What Gets Cleaned Up:
1. **Old Conversations**: Conversations older than 1 hour for the user
2. **Context Cache**: All context cache entries for the user/session
3. **Tool Metrics**: Tool usage metrics older than 24 hours for the user

### Cleanup Results Logging:
- Number of conversations cleaned
- Number of context entries cleaned
- Number of tool metrics cleaned
- Cleanup duration
- Any errors encountered

### Example Logout Log:
```
INFO:main:User session abc123 logged out successfully
INFO:backend.memory_layer_manager:User logout cleanup completed for user user123 in 0.045s: 5 conversations, 12 cache entries, 3 tool metrics cleaned
```

## Testing

Created `test_startup.py` to verify:
- Memory manager initialization works correctly
- Shared memory manager setup functions properly
- No duplicate initialization occurs
- All components integrate correctly

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Eliminates duplicate memory manager instances
2. **Cleaner Startup Logs**: Single initialization message with configuration details
3. **Better Performance**: Shared instances reduce overhead
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: User data is cleaned up on logout
5. **Improved Monitoring**: Better logging and error tracking
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized memory management

## Configuration

The memory cleanup behavior can be configured through `memory_config.py`:
- Retention policies for different data types
- Cleanup intervals and thresholds
- Performance settings
- Logging levels

All cleanup operations respect the configured retention policies while providing immediate cleanup on user logout for better privacy and performance.
