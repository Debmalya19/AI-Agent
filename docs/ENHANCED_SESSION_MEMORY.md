# Enhanced Session Memory and Learning System

## Overview

The AI Agent system includes comprehensive session memory and learning functionality that enables the LLM to learn from previous chat responses and provide contextually aware, personalized answers. This system continuously improves response quality by analyzing conversation patterns, tool usage effectiveness, and user preferences.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent Session Memory**
- **Persistent Conversation Storage**: All conversations are stored with metadata including tools used, performance metrics, and quality scores
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Previous conversations are analyzed for relevance to current queries
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Users can resume conversations and maintain context across different sessions

### ðŸ“ˆ **Adaptive Learning System**
- **Tool Usage Learning**: System learns which tools are most effective for different types of queries
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies conversation patterns and user preferences
- **Quality Score Tracking**: Monitors response quality and learns from successful interactions
- **Adaptive Tool Selection**: Automatically selects the best tools based on historical success rates

### ðŸ”§ **Enhanced Tool Orchestration**
- **Learning-Based Tool Selection**: Tools are selected based on historical performance for similar queries
- **Performance Tracking**: Each tool usage is tracked with success rates and execution times
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: System falls back to alternative tools when primary choices fail
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Multiple tools can be executed concurrently for comprehensive responses

### ðŸ“Š **Analytics and Insights**
- **Learning Insights**: Provides insights into conversation patterns and improvement suggestions
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks system performance and learning effectiveness
- **User-Specific Analytics**: Analyzes individual user patterns for personalized experiences
- **Tool Effectiveness Reports**: Shows which tools are most successful for different query types

## How It Works

### 1. **Conversation Storage**
Every interaction is stored with comprehensive metadata:
```python
conversation = ConversationEntryDTO(
    session_id="session_123",
    user_id="user_456",
    user_message="What are your support hours?",
    bot_response="Our support hours are...",
    tools_used=["BTSupportHours", "SupportKnowledgeBase"],
    tool_performance={"BTSupportHours": {"success": True, "execution_time": 0.5}},
    context_used=["support_context"],
    response_quality_score=0.9,
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)
```

### 2. **Context Retrieval with Learning**
When processing new queries, the system:
- Retrieves relevant previous conversations
- Analyzes tool usage patterns
- Identifies successful interaction patterns
- Enhances context with learned insights

### 3. **Adaptive Tool Selection**
The system selects tools based on:
- Historical success rates for similar queries
- User-specific tool preferences
- Tool performance metrics
- Query type analysis

### 4. **Continuous Learning**
After each interaction, the system:
- Updates tool performance metrics
- Records conversation patterns
- Adjusts tool selection algorithms
- Improves context relevance scoring

## API Endpoints

### Learning Insights
```http
GET /learning/insights
Cookie: session_token=your_session_token

Response:
{
  "total_conversations": 25,
  "avg_quality_score": 0.85,
  "most_successful_tools": ["BTSupportHours", "SupportKnowledgeBase"],
  "conversation_patterns": [...],
  "improvement_suggestions": [...]
}
```

### Conversation Patterns
```http
GET /learning/conversation-patterns
Cookie: session_token=your_session_token

Response:
{
  "total_conversations": 25,
  "recent_topics": [["support", 5], ["billing", 3]],
  "successful_interactions": 20,
  "tool_usage_patterns": [["SupportKnowledgeBase", 15], ["BTSupportHours", 8]]
}
```

## Configuration

The learning system is configured through `backend/memory_config.py`:

```python
# Learning configuration
enable_tool_analytics = True
enable_context_retrieval = True
enable_database_storage = True

# Performance settings
max_context_entries = 10
max_conversation_history = 50
min_relevance_score = 0.3

# Quality thresholds
tool_success_threshold = 0.6
response_quality_threshold = 0.7
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat with Learning
```python
from backend.intelligent_chat.chat_manager import ChatManager
from backend.memory_layer_manager import MemoryLayerManager

# Initialize components
memory_manager = MemoryLayerManager()
chat_manager = ChatManager(memory_manager=memory_manager)

# Process message with learning
response = await chat_manager.process_message(
    message="What are your support hours?",
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="session_456"
)

print(f"Response: {response.content}")
print(f"Tools used: {response.tools_used}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence_score}")
```

### Get Learning Insights
```python
# Get insights about learned patterns
insights = chat_manager.get_learning_insights("user_123")

print(f"Total conversations: {insights['total_conversations']}")
print(f"Average quality: {insights['avg_quality_score']}")
print(f"Successful tools: {insights['most_successful_tools']}")
```

### Manual Tool Learning Update
```python
# Update learning models after interaction
await chat_manager._update_learning_models(
    message="Support hours question",
    tools_used=["BTSupportHours"],
    tool_performance={"BTSupportHours": {"success": True, "execution_time": 0.5}},
    response_quality=0.9
)
```

## Testing

### Run Demo
```bash
cd ai-agent
python examples/demo_session_memory_learning.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
cd ai-agent
python tests/test_enhanced_session_memory.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the application: `python main.py`
2. Open the chat interface: `http://localhost:8000/chat.html`
3. Have several conversations on similar topics
4. Check learning insights: `GET /learning/insights`
5. Observe improved responses for similar queries

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Conversations are automatically cleaned up based on retention policies
- Context retrieval is optimized with relevance scoring
- Tool performance metrics are cached for quick access

### Scalability
- Database indexes optimize query performance
- Context retrieval is limited to prevent memory issues
- Background cleanup processes maintain system performance

### Quality Assurance
- Response quality scores ensure only good interactions are learned from
- Tool success thresholds prevent learning from failed interactions
- Pattern analysis validates learning effectiveness

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Metrics
The system tracks various health metrics:
- Memory usage and performance
- Learning effectiveness
- Tool success rates
- Response quality trends

### Cleanup and Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup of old conversations
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- Regular health checks and monitoring

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
- **Low learning effectiveness**: Check quality score thresholds
- **Poor tool selection**: Verify tool performance metrics
- **Memory issues**: Review retention policies and cleanup settings
- **Slow responses**: Check context retrieval limits and database performance

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Semantic Similarity**: Use embeddings for better context matching
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: ML-based conversation pattern analysis
