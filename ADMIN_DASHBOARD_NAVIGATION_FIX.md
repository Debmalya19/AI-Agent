# Admin Dashboard Navigation Fix

## Problem
The admin dashboard was generating 404 errors when trying to navigate to pages like:
- `/users.html` 
- `/tickets.html`
- `/settings.html`
- `/integration.html`

## Root Cause
The dashboard JavaScript (`dashboard.js`) was using relative paths like `users.html`, but the admin static files are mounted at `/admin/` in the FastAPI application. So the correct paths should be `/admin/users.html`.

## Solution
Updated the navigation handlers in `admin-dashboard/frontend/js/dashboard.js`:

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
window.location.href = 'tickets.html';
window.location.href = 'users.html';
window.location.href = 'settings.html';
window.location.href = 'integration.html';
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
window.location.href = '/admin/tickets.html';
window.location.href = '/admin/users.html';
window.location.href = '/admin/settings.html';
window.location.href = '/admin/integration.html';
```

## Files Changed
- `ai-agent/admin-dashboard/frontend/js/dashboard.js` - Fixed all navigation paths

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more 404 errors for admin dashboard pages
- ✅ Navigation between admin pages works correctly
- ✅ Users can access tickets, users, settings, and integration pages
- ✅ Ticket viewing functionality works with correct paths

## Static File Mounting
The admin files are correctly mounted in `main.py`:
```python
app.mount("/admin", StaticFiles(directory="admin-dashboard/frontend"), name="admin")
```

This means all admin dashboard files are accessible at `/admin/filename.html`.

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_admin_navigation.py
```

All admin pages should return 200 (OK) or 403 (Forbidden for protected pages) instead of 404 (Not Found).

## Additional Notes
- The main dashboard is accessible at both `/admin/` and `/admin/index.html`
- All admin pages exist in the `admin-dashboard/frontend/` directory
- The `/api/auth/validate` endpoint is now working correctly (200 OK responses in logs)
- Session management is functioning properly
